Transfer files over Wi-Fi from your computer to a mobile device by scanning a QR code without leaving the terminal.

## Install

Go 1.8 is required to run.

```
go get github.com/claudiodangelis/qr-filetransfer
```

### Installation through a package manager

[AUR (Arch Linux)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qr-filetransfer-git/)

## How does it work?


`qr-filetransfer` binds a web server to the address of your Wi-Fi network interface on a random port and creates a handler for it. The default handler serves the content and exits the program when the transfer is complete.

The tool prints a QR code that encodes the text:

```
http://{address}:{port}/{random_path}
```


Most QR apps can detect URLs in decoded text and act accordingly (i.e. open the decoded URL with the default browser), so when the QR code is scanned the content will begin downloading by the mobile browser.

## Usage


![Screenshot](screenshot.jpg)


**Note**: Both the computer and device must be on the same Wi-Fi network.

On the first run, `qr-filetransfer` will ask to choose which **network interface** to use to transfer the files. Choose the network interface connected to your Wi-Fi:

```
$ qr-filetransfer /tmp/file
Choose the network interface to use (type the number):
[0] enp3s0
[1] wlp0s20u10
```

_Note: On Linux it usually starts with `wl`._


The chosen network will be saved and no more setup is necessary, unless the `-force` argument is passed, or the `.qr-filetransfer.json` file the program stores in the home directory of the current user is deleted.

Two transfers mode are supported: **desktop-to-mobile** and **mobile-to-desktop**


## Desktop to Mobile

Transfer a single file

```
qr-filetransfer /path/to/file.txt
```

Zip the file, then transfer it

```
qr-filetransfer -zip /path/to/file.txt
```

Transfer a full directory. Note: the **directory is zipped** by the program before being transferred

```
qr-filetransfer /path/to/directory
```

## Mobile to Desktop

If you want to use it the other way, you need to pass the `-receive` flag. 

The first argument is the directory you want to transfer mobile files to.

```
qr-filetransfer -receive ~/Downloads
```

Specify the port to use for the web server

```
qr-filetransfer -port=8080 /path/to/my-file
```

**Note:** if the `-port` argument is passed, the value is stored and used for all future transfers. Use `-force` to reset the stored port value.

## Tips & Tricks

### Keep server alive

If you are trying to transfer a file that the browser on the receiving end is considering harmful, you can be asked by the browser if you really want to keep the file or discard it; this condition (browser awaiting your answer) can lead to qr-filetransfer disconnection. To prevent qr-filetransfer from disconnecting, use the `-keep-alive` flag:

```sh
qr-filetransfer -keep-alive /path/to/my/totally/cool.apk
```

## Arguments

- `-debug` increases verbosity
- `-quiet` ignores non critical output
- `-force` ignores saved configuration
- `-zip` zips the content before transferring it
- `-port` sets port to bind the server to
- `-receive` enables transfers from mobile to desktop
- `-keep-alive` keeps the server alive after completing the transfer
